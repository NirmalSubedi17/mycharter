# My Spectrum  
### Xamarin â€“ Practical Coding Test (Xamarin Native - iOS)

##### Programming Problem -
Provide a production ready solution that accepts a new user name, validates a single string input as the password, and stores it locally. The solution should be written in C#/Xamarin with native UI (Android or iOS, your choice, not Xamarin Forms)
UI requirements:
1. The UI should have at least a page that is a list of users and their information.
2. The UI should have the ability to add a new user, which brings up a new screen, and then appends that user to the bottom of the list view.
3. Alert the user if their passwords are invalid either on submission or real time.

The following are the string validations:
1. String must consist of a mixture of letters and numerical digits only, with at least one of each.
2. String must be between 5 and 12 characters in length.
3. String must not contain any sequence of characters immediately followed by the same sequence
